## Inspiration
WaveWeaver was inspired by the need for a modern, user-friendly audio mixing tool. Traditional digital audio workstations (DAWs) often have a steep learning curve and require expensive software installations. We wanted to create an accessible, web-based alternative that allows musicians and producers to intuitively work with separated audio tracks, whether for remixing, editing, or creative sound design.

## What it does
WaveWeaver is a web-based audio mixing application that provides powerful yet intuitive tools for music production. It allows users to:
- **Separate audio tracks into individual stems** (vocals, instrumental, drums, bass) using high-quality AI-based processing
- **Visualize multiple audio tracks** with a dynamic, multi-track waveform display
- **Adjust track timing and volume precisely** for seamless audio alignment
- **Apply envelope-based volume automation** for smooth dynamic control
- **Enable region-based looping and editing** to streamline music production workflows
- **Control playback in real time**, ensuring smooth performance across different devices and browsers

## How we built it
- **Frontend:** Developed with **Next.js** and **TypeScript** for maintainability and type safety
- **UI Components:** Utilized **Shadcn/ui** to provide a clean, accessible, and responsive interface
- **Audio Processing:** Integrated **wavesurfer-multitrack** for waveform visualization, playback, and real-time audio manipulation
- **Backend:** Built with **Node.js and Express** to handle audio file management and asynchronous processing
- **Audio Separation:** Untilized **demucs**, an advanced deep-learning model, to achieve high-quality stem separation

## Challenges we ran into
- **Managing complex state across multiple audio tracks** while ensuring smooth playback and UI responsiveness
- **Handling large audio files efficiently** to minimize latency and optimize processing speed
- **Implementing precise timing controls** to maintain synchronization between separated stems
- **Ensuring smooth playback across different browsers** with consistent performance and minimal lag
- **Optimizing memory usage** when rendering and interacting with multiple waveform visualizations
- **Maintaining a balance between real-time processing and performance** without overloading the clientâ€™s system

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **Developed an intuitive, responsive interface** that makes professional audio mixing accessible to everyone
- **Implemented precise track control with envelope automation**, enabling smooth and natural volume transitions
- **Achieved high-quality stem separation** using machine learning techniques
- **Built a robust error handling system** to manage file processing failures and ensure stability
- **Designed a scalable architecture** that allows for future expansion and feature additions
- **Optimized performance** to ensure smooth real-time audio manipulation, even in a web-based environment

## What we learned
- **Deep understanding of audio processing in the browser**, including Web Audio API techniques
- **Best practices for handling large audio files**, reducing memory footprint and improving load times
- **The importance of type safety** in complex applications, leveraging TypeScript for better code reliability
- **Integration of AI-based audio processing** into web applications
- **Balancing UI complexity with performance**, ensuring that advanced features do not slow down the user experience

## What's next for WaveWeaver
- **Add support for more audio effects and processing**, such as reverb, EQ, and dynamic compression
- **Implement track export functionality**, allowing users to download their mixed tracks in various formats
- **Integrate MIDI control**, enabling external hardware integration for a more hands-on mixing experience
- **Enhance waveform visualization** with features like spectral analysis and beat detection
- **Develop collaborative features** for real-time remote mixing sessions, utilizing WebRTC or cloud-based state sharing
- **Implement undo/redo functionality** to improve workflow efficiency
- **Expand audio format support and increase sample rate options** for professional-grade audio quality

WaveWeaver is just the beginning of a more accessible and collaborative approach to digital music production. We are excited to continue evolving the platform to meet the needs of musicians, producers, and audio engineers worldwide.
